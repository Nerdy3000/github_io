## About Me

I'm a software engineer with experience leading other engineers.

I've been told I’m good at "breaking down the systems that are happening and understanding the people in it". I try to understand how the systems impact the people, and what other perspectives and motivations are driving the current system.

I strongly believe in knowledge sharing and enjoy learning new things and helping others learn new things. I enjoy empowering others to think and act independently, as well as encouraging them to coach others. When helping others learn it also encourages me to be curious and dig deeper, to question what I’ve learned and reinforce the lessons within myself.

### My Owner's Manual

As part of the GDR Leaders at Scale training I've done with Mercatus we learned about making Personal Owner's Manuals.

These docs help others learn the best ways to communicate with you and your values. Creating the manual is also a great introspective exercise.

### Technologies I Use

The server-side scripting language I'm most comfortable with is PHP, especially with the Laravel/Lumen which help streamline building applications and RESTful APIs. I have some experience with Python, but mainly use it for things such as scripts for Docker.  I also have experience with NodeJs.

For front-end frameworks, I have experience with VueJS and AngularJS. I regularily use NPM and Webpack for building applications.

I love to learn and play with new technologies and I'm often fast to pick them up and learn about their nuances.
