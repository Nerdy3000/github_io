## YouTube Channel Playlist

**Project description:** A Vue.js project that I built to play around with YouTube playlists.

The motivation for this project was because I wanted to watch all the videos by a specific creator on YouTube, but they have content going back 12 years and the YouTube application limits how many videos display, allowing sorting for newest or most popular, but still limited on how many videos would show.

I wanted a tool that would allow me to see all the videos uploaded from the channel and be able to paginate through the uploads.
