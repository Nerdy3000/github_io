## About Me

I'm a software engineer with experience leading other engineers.

I've been told I’m good at "breaking down the systems that are happening and understanding the people in it". I try to understand how the systems impact the people, and what other perspectives and motivations are driving the current system.

I strongly believe in knowledge sharing and enjoy learning new things and helping others learn new things. I enjoy empowering others to think and act independently, as well as encouraging them to coach others. When helping others learn it also encourages me to be curious and dig deeper, to question what I’ve learned and reinforce the lessons within myself.

## Portfolio

Most of my current work is done through Mercatus and cannot be shared publicly. The projects I work on are focused around the tools that grocery retailers use to manage their data and ecommerce experience, this includes an application that is used through an iPhone in a sled that the retailer employees use to pick the orders.  I also build other internal use tools and APIs to support the other teams.

### Open Source Web App

#### Youtube Channel Playlist

A Vue.js project that I built to play around with YouTube playlists.

The motivation for this project was because I wanted to watch all the videos by a specific creator on YouTube, but they have content going back 12 years and the YouTube application limits how many videos display, allowing sorting for newest or most popular, but still limited on how many videos would show.

I wanted a tool that would allow me to see all the videos uploaded from the channel and be able to paginate through the uploads.

### Other Tech I've Played With

#### Tableau Report: Ontario Absentee Percentage

The report can be used to filter the data available for absence percentage from schools (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/summary-of-cases-in-schools)

View the tableau report [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kelly.savoy/viz/OntarioSchoolAbsencePercentage/OntarioSchoolAbsentism)

I learned Tableau when the Tableau expert at Mercatus left the company and we needed some modifications made to the reports. I took a Udemy course and practiced on some copies of the reports until I was comfortable using Tableau.  I've since used Tableau to generate some reports for internal usage.
