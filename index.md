## About Me

I'm a software engineer with experience leading other engineers.

I've been told I’m good at "breaking down the systems that are happening and understanding the people in it". I try to understand how the systems impact the people, and what other perspectives and motivations are driving the current system.

I strongly believe in knowledge sharing and enjoy learning new things and helping others learn new things. I enjoy empowering others to think and act independently, as well as encouraging them to coach others. When helping others learn it also encourages me to be curious and dig deeper, to question what I’ve learned and reinforce the lessons within myself.

## Portfolio

Most of my current work is done through Mercatus and cannot be shared publicly. The projects I work on are focused around the tools that grocery retailers use to manage their data and ecommerce experience, this includes an application that is used through an iPhone in a sled that the retailer employees use to pick the orders.  I also build other internal use tools and APIs to support the other teams.

### Open Source Web App

#### Youtube Channel Playlist

I was recently attempting to go through all the videos uploaded by a channel that has been posting for 12 years. I realized that there was a limit of around 200 videos for all of the searching, meaning I could view the most recent 200, the most popular 200, etc, but I could not view all their videos in one list. I built myself this application so that I could run it locally and view the full list of uploads for the channel.

It was also a great exercise to get more familiarity with spinning up a new application with VueJS.

### Other Tech I've Played With

#### Tableau Report: Ontario Absentee Percentage

The report can be used to filter the data available for absence percentage from schools (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/summary-of-cases-in-schools)

View the tableau report [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kelly.savoy/viz/OntarioSchoolAbsencePercentage/OntarioSchoolAbsentism)

I learned Tableau when the Tableau expert at Mercatus left the company and we needed some modifications made to the reports. I took a Udemy course and practiced on some copies of the reports until I was comfortable using Tableau.  I've since used Tableau to generate some reports for internal usage.
