## About Me

I'm a software engineer with experience leading other engineers.

I've been told I’m good at "breaking down the systems that are happening and understanding the people in it". I try to understand how the systems impact the people, and what other perspectives and motivations are driving the current system.

I strongly believe in knowledge sharing and enjoy learning new things and helping others learn new things. I enjoy empowering others to think and act independently, as well as encouraging them to coach others. When helping others learn it also encourages me to be curious and dig deeper, to question what I’ve learned and reinforce the lessons within myself.

## Portfolio

Most of my current work is done through Mercatus and cannot be shared publicly. The projects I work on are focused around the tools that grocery retailers use to manage their data and ecommerce experience, this includes an application that is used through an iPhone in a sled that the retailer employees use to pick the orders.  I also build other internal use tools and APIs to support the other teams.
